# Used for [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-4AHcoC87nNvgFR2N41UzlZmeTx6XAMbG7OPKYUJ_5g/edit?usp=sharing).

# How to use:
1. With the sheet open in Google Sheets, navigate to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet).
2. After cloning the git, drag the .csv file into the main directory.
    * (Same folder as "Program.cs").
3. Rename the .csv file to "sheet.csv" or just "sheet" if you have file name extensions turned off.
    * (If there is already a file called "sheet", just replace it with the new one you downloaded).
4. Sheet is now able to be used by the processor.
